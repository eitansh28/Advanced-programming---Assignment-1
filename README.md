# Advanced-programming---Assignment-1

The purpose of this assignment is to simulate a 'shell', that is, a kind of shell that allows certain commands to be run through it.
---
<sub>Some of the commands - writing and adding to a file, transferring the standard output or the error file to another file, echo, repeating previous commands, defining new variables, pipe, if-else and more.<sub>
---
Some assumptions -

- in the 'read' command, only one variable can be defined at a time.

- The 'pipe' doesn't work for the 'if-else' command.
